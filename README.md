# RFID-based-Door-Lock-System

1. An RFID-based door lock is a type of electronic lock that uses RFID technology for access control. Instead of using a traditional mechanical key, an RFID-based door lock uses an RFID reader to read a unique identification code from an RFID tag or card that is held near the reader. If the identification code matches an authorized code stored in the lock's memory, the door will unlock.

2. RFID-based door locks are popular in commercial and residential applications where access control is important. They offer several advantages over traditional key-based locks, such as:

3. Convenience: With an RFID-based door lock, there is no need to carry a physical key or remember a combination. Access can be granted by simply holding an RFID tag or card near the reader.

4. Security: RFID-based door locks are more secure than traditional key-based locks, as the identification code cannot be easily duplicated or guessed. Additionally, the lock's memory can be programmed to allow only authorized users to access the lock.

5. RFID-based door locks can be standalone or networked, and they can be integrated with other security systems such as surveillance cameras and alarms. They can also be customized with various features such as time-based access control, anti-tampering measures, and remote control.
